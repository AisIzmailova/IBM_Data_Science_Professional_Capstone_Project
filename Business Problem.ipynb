For families with kids it is sometimes difficult to find the best neighborhood community to live in, since they have many considerations and things to keep in mind. For example, parents with small kids need to find available daycare that should be at a walking distance from their home. In case, there are older kids in a family, there also should be elementary/middle school nearby. As well as grocery stores and medical centers need to be in close proximity. Availability of public transport and work commute is also very important. As a result, it might be challenging for some families to find a perfect place to live. \n\nThe goal of this Capstone Project is to analyze data for all 185 neighborhoods in Calgary based on selected criteria and identify top 10 best communities in the city. \n"
